## Overview

Our dogs do so much for us and our mental health, and there's no better way to give back than to take them out and see 
the world.

Dog parks can be a dicey gamble depending on location, etiquette, usuals, and overall environment. We want users to be 
able to find parks and local meetup spots in order to provide better socialization opportunities and enrichment for 
their dogs. Users can locate and commune with fellow dog enthusiasts based on the category of dog 
(size, age, temperament, etc.) and activity and users in their area.
